Hi 👋, I'm **Bahattin Yunus Çetin**  
A **Software Engineering** student passionate about coding and technology.  
🌱 Currently, I'm focusing on improving my skills in **Python**, **Java**, and **C** programming languages. I’m also diving into the exciting fields of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Science**, with a growing interest in how these technologies can solve real-world problems.

⚡ I love **coding** and enjoy tackling challenges that allow me to learn and grow. I have a keen interest in **Software Engineering** principles, and I’m constantly working on projects that involve both front-end and back-end development, along with artificial intelligence applications.

💻 **Technologies & Tools** I am currently working with:
- **Python**: For scripting, data analysis, and AI/ML projects.
